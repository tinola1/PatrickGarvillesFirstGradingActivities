                K–12 Has Become the Most Targeted Segment for Ransomware
            </h1>
            <p>

        <p>The FBI and other federal security agencies released a joint report that revealed an unsettling statistic for the 2020–2021 school year: the K–12 education segment has become not only the No. 1 target for ransomware since back-to-school, but it also makes up the majority of all ransomware attacks.</p>
        <p>According to the report, 57 percent of all reported ransomware attacks in August and September were targeted at K–12, with actors exploiting the move to remote learning to cause disruptions. That’s up from 28 percent for the period from January through July.</p>
        <p>Ransomware is a form of malware in which the attacker gains access to the victim’s computer systems and then holds the victim’s systems and/or data for ransom. Perpetrators demand money on the threat of disabling computer systems that they’ve gained control over or releasing personal data they’ve stolen (generally private student data in the case of K–12 incidents).</p>
        <p>The report, released Dec. 10, was created in a collaboration between the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).

            “The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC have received numerous reports of ransomware attacks against K-12 educational institutions. In these attacks, malicious cyber actors target school computer systems, slowing access, and — in some instances — rendering the systems inaccessible for basic functions, including distance learning. Adopting tactics previously leveraged against business and industry, ransomware actors have also stolen — and threatened to leak — confidential student data to the public unless institutions pay a ransom.”
            
            According to the report: “The five most common ransomware variants identified in incidents targeting K-12 schools between January and September 2020 — based on open source information as well as victim and third-party incident reports made to MS-ISAC — are Ryuk, Maze, Nefilim, AKO, and Sodinokibi/REvil.”
            
            The FBI does not recommend paying ransoms. According to the report: “Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, regardless of whether your organization decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical information they need to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law.”</p>
