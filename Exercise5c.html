            <p>
                Mango Graham Float also known as Crema De Mangga is a type of dessert made in the Philippines. It is made up of layers of graham 
                crackers, some type of cream, and ripe mangoes(so that the taste will be sweeter). It is chilled 
                in a refrigerator right after being made. When going to a filipino party you would expect to see this, followed
                by gulaman and any other filipino dessert. It can be made with different ingredients other than
                Mango.
