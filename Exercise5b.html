            <p>Sinigang is one of the most popular Filipino dishes that is still being cooked til this day.
                 It is a stew that has a soury taste and can be made with simple ingredients found in the market. 
                 Sinigang can be made with different ingredients, it can be made with shrimp, pork and fish. For me, 
                 I prefer the one that is made with Pork since I like to eat pork. It is served hot to everyone, 
                 you can still eat it cold but it is much more better when you eat it while it's hot. It is a food that
                  goes well with rice.
