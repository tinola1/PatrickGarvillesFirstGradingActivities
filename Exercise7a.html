            Set in the imaginary Barangay Husay, Eman teams up with his two friends, Toto and Carlo who start 
            as the underdogs, failing at every opportunity to succeed in their small-time scams. They then meet Nicoy who 
            becomes part of Eman's group breaking the tradition of having only 3 members per gang. Basically it is a movie
            about a group of useless thieves who are doing many different techniques in order to steal from someone but they
            they always somehow manage to fail. This is one of my most favorite movies because it made me laugh alot and that it isn't
            all about stealing, it is also about how parents still love their children even though the children always makes different
            kinds of mistakes.

            A silent Voice is a 2016 Japanese animated drama film produced by Kyoto Animation. It is directed by Naoko
            Yamada and written by Reiko Yoshida, featuring character designs by Futoshi Nishiya and music by kensuke Ushio.
            It is a movie about a girl who was bullied throughout her Elementary years and suddenly changed school, the bully
            was also bullied because of what he did to the girl. It is a film about bullying and the effects of bullying to
            the persons mind. It can cause suicidal thoughts and can eventually lead the other person through depression or
            suicide. It is one of my favorite because of this movie taught me that anything I do or say can affect someone 
            deeply and I won't even realize it.

            When a group of misfits are hired by an unknown third party to burglarize a desolate house and acquire a rare VHS tape,
            they discover more found footage than they bargained for. It is one of the most gruesome movies I have watched til this
            day, the film features different types of plot, it doesn't feature a lot of jumpscares but there are alot of gruesome scenes. 
            I would definitely watch it again.

            A group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.
            I like this film because there is a thrill factor because you wouldn't know what would happen to the other characters and that
            many things can happen to them.
